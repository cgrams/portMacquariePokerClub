			<img class="blogImage" src="../assets/blogpics/cominghome.jpg" alt="Sad picture of man walking home alone"> At the end of the night you have an opportunity to play vs loose players. As the chips get bigger and the night draws on there are a variety of factors that make people play much more loosely. And conventional when you have loose players you want to play tight and vice versa. Here are some factors that encourage late game loose play:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Fatigue</li>
			<li>Wanting to go home</li>
			<li>Low chip stack and a break coming up so not wanting to wait 10 minutes to play one hand</li>
			<li>Frustration</li>
			<li>Blinds increasing</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This means that there is equity to be picked up as the game goes into a late stage vs some players who might be exhibiting the mentioned signs.
		</p>
		<p>
			But be cautious because one of the biggest tells is when someone anouces to the table "Well I should go home" as any communication at the table is inhenrently deceptive. If they want you to know that they are ready to go home than it's probably the opposite and they want to stay. They likely have a big hand.
